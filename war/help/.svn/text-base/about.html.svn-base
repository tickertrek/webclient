    <div><span class="helpAnswer">
            Investment newbies, have you been wanting to dive into the stock market but don’t know how to do it? Do you hear a lot of stock talk but leery when the pros can’t “show you the money”? TickerTrek® allows you to create your own virtual portfolio, develop a strategy for investing, and follow other users that aren’t all talk (because you can actually track their performance).
 
  <p>  TickerTrek®’s seamless interface allows you to monitor your virtual money in real time, search and filter within different markets for working strategies, and even compete with fellow strategists for monthly cash prices. If you’re a more advanced investor, you can also sell access to your working strategies.

(1) A platform for creating a virtual portfolio for trading shares in multiple markets virtually in near real-time using actual stock market data.
<br/><br/>
(2) Historical tracking of strategies with performance data which allows for analysis and comparisons to be formed across investment. TickerTrekkers can use this process to learn investment basics
<br/><br/>
