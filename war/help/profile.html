    <h3 class="question"><a href="#">What is the difference between “Contact Email” and “Primary Email”?</a></h3>
    <div>
    <p class="helpAnswer">Primary email is the email address you used to sign up for TickerTrek®. Once you’ve sign up, you can not change it. Initially both your primary and contact emails are the same but you have the flexibility of changing your contact email later if you prefer. All communications from TickerTrek® including contest notification will be forwarded to your contact email address. Make sure you check your contact email account regularly.   
                    </p>

    <h3 class="question"><a href="#">How do I reset or change my password?</a></h3>
    <div>
    <p class="helpAnswer">If you've forgotten your password, you can reset it through the “Forgot your password” function on the Log in page. 
<br/><br/>
From the homepage, enter your TickerTrek® email address and we'll send you a Password Request verification link (Please also check your Spam folder). Click on the link to enter your new password at the TickerTrek® site. Then click Change Password to save it.
<br/><br/>
To change your password, go to your Profile page. Go to the bottom of the Profile page.
<br/>
<span class="helpNote">Note: You will need to know your current password in order to change it!
Enter your current password along with your new password, then click Change Password to save the changes. 
<br/>
If you're still having problems, contact TickerTrek using the feedback button for additional help.
