    <h3 class="question"><a href="#">What is a strategy?</a></h3>
    <div><p class="helpAnswer">
            An investment strategy is a set of objectives designed to provide an investor's asset allocation, buy and sell, and risk and return guidelines for his investment portfolio. Generally, an investment strategy will be designed around investor's individual goals, risk tolerance and future needs for capital. Some investors will prefer to maximize expected returns by investing in risky assets, others will prefer to minimize risk, but most will select a strategy somewhere in between. 

            <p>In TickerTrek®, a strategy is an investment portfolio, where you invest with virtual cash but using real data. All orders are executed in near real time and performance parameters like Overall Return, Profit Factor and many more are calculated by TickerTrek®  to evaluate a strategy. You can create a strategy to learn investing or you can follow good performing strategies by expert investors to know what to buy or Sell.  </p>
